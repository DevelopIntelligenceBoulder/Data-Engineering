# LAB Five 
## Recursive CTE and Connect by 
![Image of title](https://github.com/kerrynakayama/developintelligence_data_engineering/blob/master/Day_02/LAB_05/IMAGES/snow.jpeg)

## In this past module we went over Subqueries and CTE formats.  I have provided some data that if you look at it contains hierarchal data of an organization.

### I want you to ... 
 - build a normal recursive CTE query 
 - build a recursive CTE that will visually describe the hierarchal nature of the data 
 - Build a CTE to create a Fibonacci Sequence
 - use connect by instead of a recursive CTE to show hierarchy
 - visualize the hierarchal structure with a connect by

*Recursion is a feature that is used in almost every coding language that exists. When the data platform offers recursion you can drill into an arbitrary level of depth in a hierarchy with very good performance*

## Break into groups of no more than 3 people and write the queries
