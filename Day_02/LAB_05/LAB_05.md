# LAB Five 
## Recursive CTE and Connect by 
![Image of title](https://github.com/kerrynakayama/developintelligence_data_engineering/blob/master/Day_02/LAB_05/IMAGES/snow.jpeg)

## In this past module we went over Subqueries and CTE formats.  I have provided some data that if you look at it contains hierarchal data of an organization.

### I want you to ... 
Build the script for some a really short set of data so that you can use this in the future

*Recursion is a feature that is used in almost every coding language that exists. When the data platform offers recursion you can drill into an arbitrary level of depth in a hierarchy with very good performance*

## Break into groups of no more than 3 people and write the queries 

 - create a cte without it being recurvsive that selects all the employees from the engineering dept
 - build a recursive CTE that will visually describe the hierarchal nature of the data
 - use connect by instead of a recursive CTE to show hierarchy
 - visualize the hierarchal structure with a connect by
 
 Bonus -  Build a CTE to create a Fibonacci Sequence


*The data can be downloaded from the Files folder*
