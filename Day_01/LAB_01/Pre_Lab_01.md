### You might not have to be client or customer facing as that might be the job of your manager or analytics lead, But that does not mean you should not know what the product owner is looking for.  You may have a better way of doing something or designing the system if you know what your product owner wants to do with said product.  
-
First off hopefully your product owner has a map of what they are looking to accomplish.  They should also have your role defined and what you need to create.  Granted not all product owners are perfect.  
- 
- 
- 
When you meet with your product own have clear quesitons that you would like to know how you can help to shape the product.

### In this case your product is creating the tables so that analysis can be done on the transactions that are incoming.

#### The transactions are event based on everytime an invoice is created.  It will contain ...
- Incoice id
- Stock code of the item that is on the invoice
- description of the stock item **hint - check through what these might be first as they might point out errors in the data **
- Quantity - number of stock items being purchased ... or something else 
- invoice data - date the invoice came in (looks like it comes in daily without a timestampt - does this affect your design)
- Price - price of the individual items 
- Customer id - id of the customer who bought something 
- payment - how did the customer pay for this invoice 
- user_agent - tons of data in this - tells what device they used - ** hint - might give more information about who this user is **
- customer data - array format that has more info about the user
- seller id - id of the person who sold the items to the customer 
- country the transaction took place
