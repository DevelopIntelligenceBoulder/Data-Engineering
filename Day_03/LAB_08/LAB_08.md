#### Create at least 5 test on the data
#### Create a model that breaks your data into at least three FACT tables and 4+ DIM tables 
#### Mock up a YAML file that will start to order the creation of these tables
#### Create at least one macro
#### Use Jinja to remove a CASE WHEN loop on the data (*hint user agents have code that repeats*)
